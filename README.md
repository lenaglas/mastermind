# Mastermind

This project was implemented during and because of covid-lockdown-boredom. The boardgame classic [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) is about breaking a pattern of coloured gaming pegs the other player has come up with in secret. The player who tries to break the code gets feedback for every pattern he or she suggests. This is given in form of black or white colored pegs - a black key peg is placed for each peg which is correct in both color and position, a white one is placed for every peg with the right colour but at a wrong position. 
During lockdown I played the game with dad and was amazed how it is possible to get the right combination out of 5<sup>5</sup>=3125 possible ones (playing combinations with 5 pegs and 5 possible colours) in usually under 5 moves so I wanted to know how the number of possible combinations left breaks down after each feedback given.
The game implemented in python lets you play a mastermind in console. The program comes up with a random combination and gives you feedback on each attempt plus the possible combinations left.
